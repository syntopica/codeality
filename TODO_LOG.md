- [x] Root `pnpm knip` vs per-template `pnpm knip` disagreed about
      `vitest-environment-nuxt` (`templates/nuxt-app`). Task 8 declared the
      dependency in `templates/nuxt-app/package.json` because
      `app/components/TheCounter.test.ts`'s `// @vitest-environment nuxt` pragma
      genuinely needs it resolvable, and the per-template `knip.config.ts`
      correctly demanded that. The root `knip.config.ts` couldn't see that same
      usage — its `templates/nuxt-app` workspace override sets `vitest: false`
      to dodge a real `@nuxt/kit`/jiti crash in knip's vitest plugin — so it
      flagged the newly-declared dependency as unused, dropping root `pnpm knip`
      from exit 0 to exit 1. Reproduced the original crash by temporarily
      re-enabling the plugin: knip failed to load
      `templates/nuxt-app/vitest.config.ts`, unable to resolve `@nuxt/kit`,
      confirming `vitest: false` still has to stay. Resolved by adding
      `vitest-environment-nuxt` to a narrowly-scoped `ignoreDependencies` entry
      on the root config's `templates/nuxt-app` workspace override (alongside
      the existing `TEMPLATE_ESLINT_PEER_DEPENDENCIES`, with a comment
      explaining the dependency is real and only invisible because the vitest
      plugin is off there) rather than reverting the dependency or re-enabling
      the plugin. Verified: `pnpm knip` (root) exit 0,
      `pnpm -r --filter "./templates/*" knip` exit 0, `pnpm check:ci` exit 0.
- [x] `@busirocket/quality-config` was not a root `devDependency` (removed by
      Task 6 as genuinely unused at the time). Task 9 re-added it
      (`pnpm add -D -w @busirocket/quality-config@workspace:*`) and the new root
      `.dependency-cruiser.cjs` now consumes it via
      `jiti('@busirocket/quality-config/dependency-cruiser')`, giving it a real
      consumer. Because that load goes through a dynamic string argument rather
      than a static import, root `pnpm knip` still flagged it as unused; fixed
      with a scoped `ignoreDependencies` entry for the package on the `.`
      workspace in `knip.config.ts`, with a comment explaining why. Verified:
      `pnpm knip` (root) exit 0, `pnpm deps:graph` exit 0, `pnpm check:ci`
      exit 0.
- [x] `includeEntryExports` probe surfaced `bootstrap` in
      `templates/nestjs-app/src/main.ts` as an apparently-dead export. Attempted
      to drop the `export` keyword; `pnpm lint` then failed on
      `code-policy/no-hidden-top-level-declarations` (this repo's Primary Unit
      Rule, enforced via `eslint-plugin-code-policy`), which requires every
      top-level declaration to be exported so a file never carries a hidden
      internal helper. Reverted the drop. `bootstrap` is not dead code: it looks
      unused only because `src/main.ts` is a process entry point that nothing
      inside this monorepo imports as a module (same shape as
      `main.tsx`/`page.tsx` in the other templates) — the export exists to
      satisfy the template's own one-exported-unit-per-file convention, not to
      be consumed by an in-repo caller. No source change needed; documented in
      `TODO.md`'s `includeEntryExports` entry.
